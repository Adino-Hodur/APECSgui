SSLTool is an open source Matlab based toolbox for bioelectromagnetic data 
(EEG/MEG) visualization, surface Laplacian calculation and modeling. 
It can compute surface Laplacian on realistic head surfaces given by 
a triangular mesh. It has a friendly GUI.


Please refer to doc/index.html for full descriptions.


To Use:
- Put the folder on Matlab search path.
- Type "ssltool" without the quotation mark.
- If you are using it for the first time, you probably need to run 
  "sslmakeall" to compile some binary files.
  

A Quick Tutorial:
- Run ssltool.
- Click "Load Model"; click open to load default model.
- Click "Load Data"; then click ok, then click open to load default data.
- Goto Plot & Movie tab, click the play movie button; 
- Drag mouse on the canvas to rotate.
- Play around with Plot & Movie tab and Graphic tab.
- Click "Export" at the Main tab.
