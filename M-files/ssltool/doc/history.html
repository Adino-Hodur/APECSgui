<p class="TextWithEq"><span style='position:relative;left:40%'><img src="fig/eq02.gif" width=120 height=44></span></p>

<p class="TextWithEq">Apparently, the first EEG surface Laplacian algorithm
was implemented by Hjorth (1975) to improve spatial resolution and eliminate
the influence of reference electrode distortions. No firm theoretical
justification was provided by Hjorth at that time, but his approach seemed, superficially,
to serve as a plausible extension of current source density (CSD) then popular
with physiologists doing depth recordings in animal cortex. CSD consists of
estimating second derivatives of recorded field potentials in a single cortical
depth coordinate to reveal local synaptic current sources more sharply. Some
neuroscientists then used the labels &quot;CSD&quot; and &quot;Laplacian&quot;
interchangeably, failing to acknowledge important differences.</p>

<p class="TextWithEq">The early absence of a clear theoretical justification
probably delayed wider adoption of Laplacians by the EEG community and later
led to misunderstandings. However, Katznelson and Nunez (1981) showed that EEG surface
Laplacians provide estimates of local current flux through the skull into the
scalp; this theoretical connection follows mainly from the high relative
resistivity of skull tissue, which tends to focus current normal to local skull
surface. This interpretation implies that Laplacians should be especially
sensitive to dipole sources oriented normal to local skull, assuming
approximately constant tissue resistivities over the surface. Still, the number
of available EEG channels was limited to less than about 20 at that time; accuracy
of Laplacian estimates was similarly limited. Initial enthusiasm for the
Laplacian was muted by this critical technological barrier.</p>

<p class="TextWithEq">In the early 1990s, several EEG scientists
  criticized Laplacian methods for having only minimal theoretical justification
  (van Dijk and Spekreijse 1992). In response, Nunez and Westdorp (1994), Srinivasan
  et al (1996), Kramer and Szeri (2004), and Nunez and Srinivasan (2006) showed that
  for high resistivity skulls, the surface Laplacian is related to the inner
  skull <span style='position:relative;top:4.0pt'><img
src="fig/eq04.gif" alt="PHI_i" width=20 height=16></span> potential
  and outer skull <span style='position:relative;top:4.0pt'><img width=20
height=16 src="fig/eq05.gif"></span> potential by the approximate relation</p>

<p class="TextWithEq"><span style='position:relative;left:40%'><img
src="fig/eq06.gif" alt="" width="120" height="20" /></span></p>

<p class="TextWithEq">Here the constant <i>A</i> depends on local
cortical, skull, and scalp thicknesses and resistivities. When cortical sources
are localized as in the case of single dipoles or small dipole layers,
potentials fall off rapidly between cortex (or dura surface) and scalp, that
is, <span style='position:relative;top:4.0pt'><img width=64 height=16
src="fig/eq07.gif"></span> and
the surface Laplacian is approximately proportional to local cortical (or dura)
potential. By contrast, when cortical sources form very large (perhaps &gt; 10
cm diameter dipole layers), the inner and outer skull potentials have similar
magnitudes so that scalp Laplacians are small. This interpretation then
emphasizes that unprocessed scalp potentials and scalp Laplacians are
complementary measures of cortical source behavior, sensitive to different scales
of activity. EEG interpretations (source localization, functional connectivity,
and so forth) can be substantially facilitated by employing both measures to
the same data sets (Nunez and Srinivasan 2006). </p>

<p class="TextWithEq">Still another set of studies compared cortical
potential distributions predicted by the New Orleans surface Laplacian with
inner projections based on a three-sphere model labeled Melbourne dura imaging
(Nunez et al. 2001; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006). Typical correlations between
these two independent estimates of cortical potential based on both genuine
131-channel EEG and simulations with distributed sources in a three-sphere head
model were in the 0.95 range, thereby adding additional support for the
Laplacian. </p>

<p class="TextWithEq">Hjorth's original work employed a very simple
nearest-neighbor algorithm to estimate Laplacians. Such estimates were, for all
algorithms, severely limited by sparse sampling density. Later, after EEG
systems with many more channels became easily available, a French group developed
substantially improved Laplacian algorithms based on fitting surface potential
maps to either planar or spherical spline functions (Perrin et al., 1987,
1989). These functions were then differentiated analytically to estimate scalp surface
Laplacians. This spline Laplacian approach was later extended to include
ellipsoidal (Law et al. 1993) and more realistic scalp surfaces (Babiloni et
al. 1996). More recently, several additional algorithms have been developed to
estimate Laplacians more accurately on realistic human heads imaged with MRI
(recent work by Irvine group, 2011).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p class="TextWithEq">One important Laplacian application is to provide
more accurate estimates of EEG coherence patterns, which provide important
measures of functional segregation and integration between cortical regions;
such measures vary substantially across cognitive tasks. Before the 1990s some
EEG scientists and animal physiologists suspected that the observed high scalp
coherence over large distances (&gt; 5 to 20 cm) did not reflect cortical
source coherence, but resulted only from volume conduction. This view was based
partly on the fast fall off of coherence (typically over less than 1 cm) recorded
from animal cortex with mm scale electrodes. But, this volume conduction interpretation
ignores the fact that high human scalp coherence is mostly confined to narrow
frequency bands (typically the lower range of alpha frequencies), and volume
conduction is essentially independent of frequency. This misunderstanding
involved failure to appreciate that the dynamic variables that characterize
complex systems are generally expected to be scale-sensitive (Nunez 1995, 2010;
Nunez et al. 1997, 2001; Nunez and Srinivasan 2010; Sporns 2010). Thus,
cortical coherence patterns estimated with mm scale (mesoscopic) cortical
electrodes are not generally expected to mirror (macroscopic) scalp coherence
between the same cortical regions. </p>

<p class="TextWithEq">The issue of genuine large long-range scalp
coherence seemed to be finally settled when alpha band Laplacian-based coherence
estimates were often found to be large at 10 to 20 cm separations and showed
large changes with cognitive tasks (Nunez 1995; Nunez et al. 2001). But, some
scientists advanced still another objection, claiming that coherence estimates
obtained from spline Laplacian algorithms produce erroneously high coherence
estimates due to the global nature of spline fits (Biggins et al. 1991, 1992). This
result was, however, shown to be based on faulty simulation methods; that is, bypassing
head model simulations and simply submitting random numbers to the spline
algorithm (Perrin et al. 1992; Nunez et al. 1994, 1997). It has been shown that
the spline-Laplacian coherence estimates are typically conservative; that is,
they tend to underestimate cortical source coherence by filtering out the very
low spatial frequencies (Srinivasan et al. 1998; Nunez and Srinivasan 2006).
Note also that large alpha band coherence at 10 to 20 cm scalp separations is
easily obtained with (close) bipolar recordings and may be manipulated with
cognitive tasks or eyes opening (Nunez 1995).</p>
