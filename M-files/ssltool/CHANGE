v 1.4a beta
09-01-2012
Fix:
    A small bug when calling syntax ssltool(D,M) the 3rd tad wont be enabled.

v 1.4 beta
08-31-2012
Fix:
    Fixed a bug that fiducial points cannot be hidden after shown.
    Fixed some bugs that cause crashes when calling the function with input 
    arguments.

v 1.3d beta
07-11-2011
Change:
    Now all mesh-dealing functions takes an SSL mesh struct as input.
    See SSLMESHSTRUCT too. Hopefully this makes mesh operation more 
    consistent and abstracts mesh structure check from other functionality.

    The name of Electrode.Cardinal is change to Electrode.Fiducial since
    the latter is a more widely accepted notion.

Fix:
    Fixed a bug that SSLTool crashes when no input was specified during 
    mesh creation.

v 1.3a beta
06-30-2011
New:
    Natively supports BVQX srf files (sslreadtrisrf.m).
    
    Support importing data and electrode info from EEGLAB. To do so, select
    import workspace variable and choose the global variable named "EEG" 
    generated by EEGLAB (for both data and electrode info). 
    
Change:
    Reordered the mesh and data import interface. Now when you are creating
    a custom model the first mesh importing step defaults to the SSLTOOL
    internal head model.

Fix:
    Fixed some minor bugs.

v 1.2c beta
06-25-2011;
New: 
    Electrode.Cardinal now you can include cardinal landmarks in Electrode
    imports to facilitate manual alignment.

Change: 
    Mesh file format .PLY is no longer supported. Added support of .OFF 
    format instead. The main reason is FSL tools export .OFF by default.    

Update:
    Documenations in doc are now up to date.

Fix:
    Mesh smoothing now works correctly. Other minor bugfix and improvement.

v 1.2a beta
04-13-2011; 
New:
    Added movie controls on Plot & Movies tab, now you can show a 
    Topo or SSL movie direcly from just 1 button click.

    SSLTool can now export spatial transformation info during alignment 
    procedure.

Fix:
    Fixed a bug so that auto centering and scaling shall now work 
    correctly.


v 1.0 beta
02-10-2011;

This first test release. With major function blocks (SSL-Geo and SSL-Sph as
well as Topographic views) working flawlessly.
